## soooo what do we have here?!

In this post I'm going to hook up the Spotify Web API with my crib. (priorities!) 
I've also requested my personal listening data from Spotify - eventually hoping to be able to data science my musical brains out! Unfortunately, the process of gathering all that information takes up to 30 days, so we'll have to sit tight in the meantime.

Alright, so I listen to copious amounts of music everyday. Today I had my headphones on for >12 hours, no breaks. Yesterday might've been 8 hours, with breaks. I'm pretty sure I clocked in >40,000 hours on my 2018 Spotify Wrapped (can't wait for 2019!!!).  

If this were another world you might say I have an addiction. and you know what,, tHaTs fInE!!!
because I absolutely pride myself on the egregious amount of music I stream (delicious!!).  

Anyways, one cool thing that Spotify does, is in fact, Wrapped! 
All these hours of music ends up turning into some (A LOT) tasty morsels of data. And Spotify does a nice job summarizing and visualizing all of this at the end of the year. Last year Spotify even added a playlist full of suggested up and coming songs, in addition to those sick stats. That's right, dont' just be a tastemaker, be a tastebreaka! (I guess??!? I had my hipster phase. I think it was just a phase.)

tl;dr - welcome to my crib. I'm going to fill it with things related to work, analysis, and other random stuff. I also like a lot of things. Hopefully I'll do something about it very soon.
