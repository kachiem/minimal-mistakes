## w e l c o m e

welcome. this is my crib.  

In this corner you'll mostly find my attempts at keeping track of my work/things I've worked on (currently things having to do with neuroscience, math, computer science, and machine learning).  

In the other corner, you might find random musings about things I care about disproportionately (relative to what you might ask? Well you'll just have to wait and see!).  
This might include: media (music/music videos/things I've read/think are aesthetic) and general reflection + analysis (note to self: stop ruminating!!). 
In the end, the goal is that my future self will look back at these posts, facepalm, and utter, "ugh I did this sooOoOoOo badly last year!" then do it again. but better.  

<!--the other 2 corners are vacant at the moment. I live in a box. so I have 8 corners total. but I'm only going to fill up 4. the other 4 are reserved for my thoughts. they take up a lot of space so I had to make this ~~blog~~ crib !!  -->

Keeping a blog is a pretty self-centric thing to do, and I'm afraid of it becoming an echo chamber of my own thoughts. 
it doesn't help that the internet is a pretty big place, and that ideas are quite spread out. 
On the other hand, that's probably just me overthinking things (ah, classic), and I'm pretty sure current me mainly intends to use this as a notebook for thoughts. anything else that happens will be icing on the cake. 

<!--I've experience a similar situation in college and I've sworn to never be apart of an environment like that again.  
how to make it happen though, I haven't made a plan for.  
I've got a hunch that keeping in touch with people, actively exchanging ideas, and in general, being part of a community are some good moves. It's just a little harder as an awkward human being.  
so that's what this blog is for?!? -->

side note, that being said, there is always more context for my opinions and how they've come to be. we do everything long-form here, for better or for worse.  

In general, for the past, roughly, year, I've been to few amazing talks/meetings and read a good many research papers. and I don't remember a thing about any of them. that goes for a lot of things in life, increasingly so.      
writing things down tends to remedy that for future karen, though. perhaps they might become useful educational tools as well. so here we go!  

to start with, here's a little bit more about me (as of right now, future iterations are subject to change):

### things I like:
- food
- coffee, tea, milk tea
- music
- learning
- machine learning?! 
- ideas
- making things.
- being healthy.
- happiness and fufillment. 
- other people. (?!?)

### things I don't like:
- not liking things

### things I'm currently working on:
- deep learning with keras. I've been stuck on this for too long.
- hackerrank's 30 days of code (currently: day 13 - abstract classes)
- buying gifts! learning how to give better.
- currently reading: 
    - Thi Bui, The Best We Could Do - a bit too relatable. makes it harder to binge read.
    - Spinoza, The Ethics - heard it was dope. likewise with FuckTheory's analysis.
    - Seneca, Letters from a Stoic - just finished the Consolation to Marcia. It was really rough and irrational. Probably warrants a seperate post.
    

### things I need to do:
- shrink the font size on these posts
- move timestamp of each post under title, instead of at bottom of post.
- breadcrumbing pages
- other cool page things
- get unstuck. 
- keep applying to things.
- go for a run/bike. (slacked off for the holidays! oop-)
- nurture my baobab tree farm (not orchard) on ForestApp

### things I want to do:
- connect spotify API to my crib.
- write a post for seneca's letters.
- write a post about getting unstuck.
- watch rain storms from the window! its nice.
- maybe cut down on the caffiene consumption for a sec.(NAH!)
- shrink the really long lists that are full of: books to read, tv shows + movies to watch.
- yeet myself somewhere. 
    - possible places: Seattle, Boston, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai, Shenzhen, *europe*, Australia,...this list is now very long.
    
- um, more shitposting irl. with code or something. haven't figured it out yet. we'll see. 
  my ultimate goals in life are to:
    1. meme harder
    2. flex
    3. ???
    4. profit!!


tl;dr - welcome to my crib. I'm going to fill it with things related to work, analysis, and other random stuff. I also like a lot of things. Hopefully I'll do something about it very soon.
